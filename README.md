# Prova-Finale-API-2021

This project consists of an algorithm that elaborates directed and weighted graphs and ranks them.
The algorithm is optimized on both space (memory usage) and time (quickness of computation) fronts.
Every command is read from command line.

This is the final project of Algorithm and Data Structures course.
